Final status — mvvm_note_app_kotlin_android_studio

Current local state (on this machine):
- Repo path: /Users/olena.imfeld/Desktop/mvvm_note_app_kotlin_android_studio
- Latest commits:
  - eb81d6a Add test engineer run instructions
  - 9106102 Fix build: remove jcenter() and pin gradle wrapper to 6.5
- Debug APK: app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk (present)
- Emulator attached: emulator-5554 (verified)

What I completed for you:
- Cloned the original repo and fixed build issues so it assembles locally.
- Built the debug APK and verified it installs/runs on the emulator.
- Added TEST_ENGINEERS_RUN.md with step-by-step instructions for testers.

What remains (I need your input):
- Create a GitHub repo under your account (or provide the HTTPS URL). I will add it as a remote and push the local master branch.

Commands I'll run once you provide the repo HTTPS URL:
  cd /Users/olena.imfeld/Desktop/mvvm_note_app_kotlin_android_studio
  git remote add userrepo <YOUR_REPO_URL>
  git push userrepo master --set-upstream

If your remote uses 'main' instead of 'master', use:
  git push userrepo master:main --set-upstream

If you prefer to push yourself, run the commands above locally replacing <YOUR_REPO_URL>.

If you want me to proceed, paste the target HTTPS repo URL here and confirm and I will push the changes from this environment.
